# EndpointsJSON

This app is designed to help you maintain an `endpoints.json` file while developing an API.

_Manually formatting the file can be a pain_, this app allows you to _concentrate on the contents_ of the file and deals with the formatting for you. **It manages formatting for**:

-   The HTML method üó≥Ô∏è
-   The endpoint path üë£
-   The detailed information for each endpoint ‚ÑπÔ∏è
-   The order of the endpoints üîÄ
-   Removing an endpoint ‚ùå
-   Adding a new endpoint with detailed information ‚ûï

| - `cd EndpointsJSON`                                           | - `cd EndpointsJSON`                                           |

> üí°The install script creates a local virtual environment to install the dependencies and locally installs the src module for sibling imports.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You may wish to consider adding the virtual environment to the path of your development environment so the dependencies can be found. [To do this in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments):

-   Open the Command Palette üé®
-   Look for "Python: Select Interpreter" üêç
-   Select the one that contains ".virtual-environment"

To keep the list of dependencies up to date, it's recommended adding and removing pip packages through `./add-package.sh` and `./remove-package.sh` üöÄ
